# Web-Desktop
Desktop-like styled web page

Features:<br/>
-Drag and drop launchers and folders.<br/>
-Open, close, minimize, grow folders.<br/>
-Create and delete folders.<br/>

The code in this example is different from the code in the drag and drop repo on my github page.<br/>
Because it works a bit different it's still is a bit buggy in some situations but overal it's a fun style for a dashboard site.<br/>
